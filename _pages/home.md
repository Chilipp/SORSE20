## What is SORSE? - Series of Online Research Software Events

With the cancellation of several international Research Software Engineering (RSE) community events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, RSEs worldwide are facing a lack of opportunities to engage with their wider community. To address this challenge, SORSE has been launched by an [international committee](contact/#organizing-committee) to provide an opportunity for RSEs to develop and grow their skills, build new collaborations and engage with RSEs worldwide. Until we can meet again in person, SORSE (pronounced ‘Source’), will bridge the gap and be the source of interesting and engaging events.

This is an open call to all RSEs and anyone involved with research software, worldwide, to propose talks, workshops and other types of online events.

The aims of the event series:

- To create and deliver a range of permanent resources for RSEs to develop both technical and soft skills, giving them the opportunity to contribute to and learn from the series
- To develop and share knowledge about the field of research software e.g. how is Research Software built and used, how do we learn the skills to improve its sustainability and reliability, how do we apply it in our research, demonstrating its importance to research,
- To encourage involvement with the collection efforts of personal and technical RSE journeys (Podcasts etc) to better understand the makeup and demographics of our community and promote diversity and inclusivity
- To develop new research relationships that may lead to future collaborations and strengthen international links within the community
- To provide a ‘Show and Tell’ opportunity for RSEs to present their ideas and their work to an international audience
- To maintain the momentum of the RSE movement by helping to build and support the national and international Research Software Communities

## How do I get involved?
Were you going to submit something to an RSE conference this year? Do you have a project you’d like to share? Is there a talk/workshop/panel you’d like to see happen? Then you’ve found the right place!

You can make a contribution to one of the event types (see above), see our [call for submissions](){: .missing} and/or suggest an event in the [Topic Bazaar](){: .missing} that you’d like to see in the series. We’re looking for both technical and soft skills and there are no set themes this year but if a theme emerges, we may group those events together to create a half day event or a run of events over a few weeks.

We encourage submissions from all time zones and will schedule events on a day and at a time that suits the presenter.  Events will be recorded so that they can be run multiple times to suit different time zones and encourage those communities to come together to network.  

## How will the submission process work?
The call for submissions will remain open and there will be a rolling monthly deadline following which all submissions received over the previous month will be sent for review by the Programme Committee. The call is open to anyone wanting to propose a research software-related talk or event from anywhere in the world, regardless of your role.   Upcoming submission deadlines are all detailed on the [submissions page](){: .missing}. Each submission deadline will have an earliest event date when events submitted prior to that deadline can take place. You can propose an event for any date or range of dates beyond this.

See our [schedule of events](){: .missing} for details of what’s coming up.


## Do I need to pay to attend SORSE events?
No! It’s completely free to the community with the national RSE Groups from many countries collaborating to bring this to you.

Any questions, please [get in touch](contact)!
