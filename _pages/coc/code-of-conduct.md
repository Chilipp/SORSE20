We value the participation of each stakeholder and want all participants to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other participants throughout the events and through all communication channels, including but not limited to the zoom room, zoom webinar, youtube channel, discord platform and the slack channel.  

To make clear what is expected, all participants, speakers, exhibitors, organisers and volunteers involved in SORSE are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organisers will enforce this code.

## Summary

SORSE organisers are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.  All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees.

Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and exclusionary jokes are not appropriate. Do not send any unprofessional messages to other participants, including but not limited to private messages in Slack, Zoom and Discord.

Participants violating these rules may be asked to leave the event at the sole discretion of the SORSE organisers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.


## Clarifications

Harassment includes offensive communication related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that words can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes are not acceptable at the SORSE events. Excessive swearing is not appropriate.

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the SORSE organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event and it may affect the offenders' ability to join future events.
