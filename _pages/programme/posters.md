# **Hey RSEs!**

We will aim to run at least one poster session every month during the event. Each session will be a one hour slot and include up to 10 posters, arranged in themes if the number of contributions allows. 

Poster presenters will be asked to pre-record a one or two minute lightning talk (depending on the number of presenters) which will be played at the start of each session. Each presenter will then be available in a break out room with video and text chat facilities to discuss their poster with those attending. Posters will be available a few days in advance of the session to allow attendees to read the material beforehand. Posters will be maximum A1 size.

## Brief summary

* 10 posters every month
* max A1 size
* lightning talk session - pre-record talk 1-2 minutes
* followed by breakout session

## Abstract Guidelines

Abstracts must include sufficient information for reviewers to judge the nature and significance of the topic and the conclusions. The abstract should summarize the substantive results of the work and not merely list topics to be discussed.An abstract is an outline/brief summary of your poster and your whole project. It should have an intro, body and conclusion. It is a well-developed paragraph, should be exact in wording, and must be understandable to a wide audience. If your title includes scientific notation, Greek letters, bold, italics, or other special characters/symbols, do make sure they appear correctly.
