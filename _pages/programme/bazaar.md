The topic bazaar is a place to encourage and create collaborations that can then be presented in a variety of formats within the conference. 
For example, someone might have an idea for a workshop but would prefer to refine their concept with a collaborator before presenting.
Another example could be someone wanting collaborators, with different skill sets, to work on their open-source project. This might lead to a talk about the open-source software, or on the collaborative process itself.

 
To participate in the Topic Bazaar, simply post your idea within this pad [LINK] and we'll advertise your topic suggestion below.
If you're interested in collaborating on a topic previously posted, follow the contact details listed to get in touch and begin working together.
Once you are ready to present, make a formal submission here[LINK], and just remember to say tell us that you came via the Topic Bazaar.
