Code review for research software is the process by which peers evaluate each other's source code. This involves checking that the code does what it claims and is written in a way that can easily be read, maintained, and built upon. Code review is an important tool for ensuring that software is high-quality and reusable, and should be a widely-adopted "best practice".

The Code Review Community Working Group (CRC) aims to build consensus and awareness around good practice in code review. The CRC is a collaboration between research software engineers, funders, society representatives, academic publishers, and researchers.

The CRC consists of 5 task forces that will begin work in 2021:

* Diversity, equity, and inclusion
* Code review during development
* Code review at the time of publication
* Recommendations for stakeholders
* Training and education

Have we piqued your interest? The CRC is keen to have you on-board; you're encouraged to participate in any of the task forces. Join us via email ([hollydawn.murray@gmail.com](mailto:hollydawn.murray@gmail.com)). Equally, don't hesitate to get in touch if you have an idea for collaboration.
