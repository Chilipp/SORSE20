Software for research comes in many different forms and technologies. This includes software that runs on mobile devices. The demand for this is growing, whether it is for "citizen-science" projects or in clinical and educational research. In this SORSE (online) roundtable event, we discuss
* examples of mobile apps for research
* what are the challenges for mobile apps in and for research. In particular:
  * logistic of deploying and delivering mobile apps
  * maintenance costs
  * distribution of apps - what are the options
  * how to build the right team for mobile apps development
* what technology stacks are used in mobile app development. And what determines the choice?
