# **Hey RSEs!**

We will aim to run at least one poster session every month during the event. Each session will be a one hour slot and include up to 10 posters, arranged in themes if the number of submissions allows.

Poster presenters will be asked to pre-record a one or two minute lightning talk (depending on the number of presenters) which will be played at the start of each session. Each presenter will then be available in a break out room with video and text chat facilities to discuss their poster with those attending. Posters will be available a few days in advance of the session to allow attendees to read the material beforehand. Posters will be maximum A1 size.

## Brief summary

* 10 posters every month
* max A1 size
* lightning talk session - pre-record talk 1-2 minutes
* followed by breakout session
