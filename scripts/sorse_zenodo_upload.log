We will introduce the topic before demonstrating three independently-developed open source directories, explaining their respective benefits and ease of use, deployment and maintenance. Then we intend to form breakout groups to discuss some of the challenges associated with maintaining and curating such directories.\n\nBy discussion of these topics with a wider audience we hope to not only promote the benefits of directories and encourage their deployment but also to identify issues and gather ideas to address them. In particular:\n\n- Curation: criteria for inclusion, data quality, scalability, automation\n- Federation: scope, data sharing, distributed search, interoperability with other systems and standards\n- Technology: platforms, data models, ease of development and maintenance\n- Sustainability: direct and indirect costs for deployment and maintenance\n\nThe platforms that will be demonstrated and used to encourage discussion are:\n\n- The [Research Software Directory][1] developed by the Netherlands eScience Center\n- The [Research Software Encyclopedia][2]\n- [GitHub Search][3] as a template for an individual or institution\n- Imperial College London's [Research Software Directory][4]\n\n  [1]: https://www.research-software.nl/\n  [2]: https://rseng.github.io/rseng/\n  [3]: https://vsoch.github.io/2020/github-search/\n  [4]: https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/research-software-directory/", 'creators': [{'name': 'Mark Woodbridge', 'affiliation': 'Imperial College London, UK', 'orcid': '0000-0002-0650-9751'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Sochat', 'affiliation': 'Stanford University, US', 'orcid': '0000-0002-4387-3819'}, {'name': 'Jurriaan Spaaks', 'affiliation': 'Netherlands eScience Center, The Netherlands', 'orcid': '0000-0002-7064-4069'}], 'communities': [{'identifier': 'sorse'}], 'conference_title': 'International Series of Online Research Software Events', 'conference_acronym': 'SORSE', 'conference_url': 'https://sorse.github.io', 'access_right': 'open', 'license': 'cc-by-4.0'}}

However, traditional research articles seldom have these embedded in the manuscript\'s narrative, but instead, leave them as "supplementary materials", if they are openly available.\n\nWith Executable Research Articles (ERAs, previously known as the Reproducible Document Stack (RDS)), our vision is to enrich the traditional narrative of a research article with code, data and interactive figures that can be executed in the browser, downloaded and explored. It will give readers a direct insight into the methods, algorithms and key data behind the published research.\n\nWe published our [first demo ERA][1] in February 2019. Over the past year, we have been working closely with our collaborator Stencila to build an open tool stack that would enable our authors and production team to easily publish ERAs at scale. In this talk, we hope to showcase the potential of ERAs with examples and walk through how authors can enrich their traditional eLife paper using Stencila Hub, through:\n\n - Starting a Stencila Hub project linked to their eLife paper\n - Converting the article to a reproducible notebook format of their\n   preference, while preserving the relevant journal article metadata\n - Uploading the data required to enable live re-execution of tables and\n   figures in the article\n - Replacing static tables and figures with code chunks that reproduce them\n\nWe will share our current vision of how ERAs will be integrated into our production workflow and collect feedback. We also hope to engage participants in exploring potential functionalities for the tool stack and building a community-driven roadmap.\n\n  [1]: https://elifesciences.org/articles/30274/executable', 'creators': [{'name': 'Dr. Emmy Tsang', 'affiliation': 'eLife, UK', 'orcid': '0000-0002-9248-1280'}], 'communities': [{'identifier': 'sorse'}], 'conference_title': 'International Series of Online Research Software Events', 'conference_acronym': 'SORSE', 'conference_url': 'https://sorse.github.io', 'access_right': 'open', 'license': 'cc-by-4.0'}}

Advances in live measurements have allowed recordings of unprecedented resolution revealing a new world of complex heterogeneous oscillations with multiple noisy non-stationary features. However, our understand- ing of the underlying mechanisms regulating these oscillations has been lagging behind, partially due to the lack of simple tools to reliably quantify these complex non-stationary features. With this challenge in mind, we have developed pyBOAT, a Python-based fully automatic stand-alone software that integrates multiple steps of non-stationary oscillatory time series analysis into an easy-to-use graphical user interface. pyBOAT implements continuous wavelet analysis which is specifically designed to reveal time-dependent features. In this work we illustrate the advantages of our tool by analyzing complex non-stationary time-series profiles. Our approach integrates data-visualization, optimized sinc-filter detrending, amplitude envelope removal and a subsequent continuous-wavelet based time- frequency analysis. Finally, using analytical considerations and numerical simulations we discuss unexpected pitfalls in commonly used smoothing and detrending operations.', 'creators': [{'name': 'Dr. Gregor M�nke', 'affiliation': 'EMBL Heidelberg, Germany'}, {'name': 'Frieda Sorgenfrei', 'affiliation': 'Austrian Centre of Industrial Biotechnology, Austria'}, {'name': 'Dr. Christoph Schmal', 'affiliation': 'Charit� Berlin, Germany'}, {'name': 'Dr. Adrian Granada', 'affiliation': 'Charit� Berlin, Germany'}], 'communities': [{'identifier': 'sorse'}], 'conference_title': 'International Series of Online Research Software Events', 'conference_acronym': 'SORSE', 'conference_url': 'https://sorse.github.io', 'access_right': 'open', 'license': 'cc-by-4.0'}}

The project structure will be explained in more detail, covering the motivation for the layered approach and the choice of tools, as well as the lessons learned from the work done by Compute Canada. The goals we have in mind and how we plan to achieve them going forward will be outlined.\n\nFinally, we will demonstrate the current pilot version of the project, and give you a feeling of the potential impact.\n\nFor more information about the EESSI project:\n\n* website: [https://www.eessi-hpc.org](https://www.eessi-hpc.org)\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/EESSI](https://github.com/EESSI)\n* documentation: [https://eessi.github.io/docs](https://eessi.github.io/docs)\n* Twitter: [https://twitter.com/eessi_hpc](https://twitter.com/eessi_hpc)', 'creators': [{'name': 'Kenneth Hoste', 'affiliation': 'Ghent University, Belgium'}], 'communities': [{'identifier': 'sorse'}], 'conference_title': 'International Series of Online Research Software Events', 'conference_acronym': 'SORSE', 'conference_url': 'https://sorse.github.io', 'access_right': 'open', 'license': 'cc-by-4.0'}}

In this talk I will cover the pros and cons of this kind of career change, the lessons I learnt and personal skills required to make the jump. Exposure to this kind of RSE career change would hopefully be insightful and useful to all attendees thinking about their future careers.\n\nThe second part of my talk will focus on the latest web development techniques that myself and colleagues use at the Wellcome Trust. We're currently building a data sharing platform for universities and funders as part of the Research on Research Institute (RoRI). I will walk through how a modern web/app development project is set up, the options for languages and frameworks at each stage and what we're using to build the RoRI platform. I will also discuss how this relates to mobile app development. From this part of the talk attendees should gain some basic knowledge on how modern web and app development is done, and how they can apply these techniques to their own RSE projects.\n\nMy talk would suit a broad target audience as it covers both RSE careers and some wide ranging techniques.

Of relevance to the software engineer audience this will include some disconnects between AI in the lab and clinical deployment.\n\nWith testing turnaround times of more than 24 hours clinicians used chest radiography as the primary diagnostic tool to assess and triage COVID-19 patients. The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to radiology in Bolton resulted in a much faster and more accurate patient diagnosis. It showed quickly if someone's condition was worsening, improving or staying the same. This led to a more efficient triaging and care of patients and optimised use of critical care resources.  The AI tool also mitigated challenges presented by the loss of medical staff due to illness, self-isolation or shielding.\n\nOur vision was to give clinicians 24/7 access to an accurate and consistent decision support tool to improve chest x-ray interpretation allowing them to make quicker and better-informed decisions about patient care.\n\nWe carried out extensive research before partnering with Qure.ai and this contributed to the [NHSx guidance](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/media/documents/NHSX_A_Buyers_Guide_to_AI_in_Health_and_Care.pdf) and [guidance by GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/assessing-if-artificial-intelligence-is-the-right-solution#assessing-if-ai-is-the-right-solution-for-your-users-needs).", 'creators': [{'name': 'Dr. Rizwan Malik', 'affiliation': 'Bolton NHS Foundation Trust, UK'}, {'name': 'Shoaib Sufi', 'affiliation': 'eScience Lab, University of Manchester, UK'}], 'communities': [{'identifier': 'sorse'}], 'conference_title': 'International Series of Online Research Software Events', 'conference_acronym': 'SORSE', 'conference_url': 'https://sorse.github.io', 'access_right': 'open', 'license': 'cc-by-4.0'}}

The task of understanding performance bottlenecks of a parallel code and making improvements often ends up being a daunting trial and error process. To make the problem even more complicated, many HPC applications inherit different layers of legacy code, written and optimized for a different computing era. To optimize the performance of a parallel application, the first step is to understand the behavior of the application. However, there is often a lack of quantitative understanding of the actual behavior of HPC applications. The Performance Optimisation and Productivity (POP) Centre of Excellence, funded by the EU under the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, attempts to establish a quantitative methodology for the assessment of parallel codes. This methodology uses a set of hierarchical metrics, where each metric represents relative impact of one cause of inefficiency in parallel codes. These metrics provide a standard, objective way to characterise different aspects of the performance of parallel codes. In this talk, I will review the development of these metrics and give examples of how use of these metrics allowed us to quickly identify the performance bottlenecks of applications from different domains of science and engineering. In addition, the POP methodology facilitates training HPC experts and performance analysts by defining a common and systematic approach to assessing and improving parallel codes.', 'creators': [{'name': 'Fouzhan Hosseini', 'affiliation': 'The Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG)'}], 'communities': [{'identifier': 'sorse'}], 'conference_title': 'International Series of Online Research Software Events', 'conference_acronym': 'SORSE', 'conference_url': 'https://sorse.github.io', 'access_right': 'open', 'license': 'cc-by-4.0'}}

Data repositories provide research dissemination following FAIR principles while also developing standards and tools to facilitate them. However, increased use of advanced research methods, such as virtual containers, supercomputers and GPUs, is introducing new challenges for research sharing. There is no standardized way of describing and disseminating such research outputs in data repositories. Furthermore, dissemination of data within virtual containers like Docker may hinder some of the commonly supported principles, such as findability and accessibility.\n\nImprovements in documenting and sharing of advanced research materials in a FAIR-compliant way has recently been natively enabled in new container-based tools. This talk will present insights from community discussions on improving FAIRness with encapsulation in the context of the Dataverse data repository platform. Dataverse has a long-term commitment to preserving research artifacts to enable research transparency, reproducibility, and reuse. We will provide a review of a number of projects based on virtual containers to determine their potentials for enabling FAIRness of published research. In particular, we will review the following projects: Open Container Initiative, Singularity, ReproZip, and SciUnit, and their efforts on documenting and describing researcher's computing environments.

However, manual image annotation tools are often designed to address one specific use case and lack the flexibility to be reused across different projects. Furthermore, these tools often have complex installation and setup procedure which presents a barrier to non-technical users. To address these limitations, we created the VGG Image Annotator [VIA](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/),  which is a light weight, standalone and offline software package that does not require any installation or setup and runs solely in a web browser. The VIA software allows human annotators to define and describe spatial regions in images or video frames,  and temporal segments in audio or video. These manual annotations can be exported to plain text data formats such as JSON and CSV and therefore are amenable to further processing by other software tools. VIA also supports collaborative annotation of a large dataset by a group of human annotators. The BSD open source license of this software allows it to be used in any academic project or commercial application.\n\nThe VIA software has quickly become an essential and invaluable research support tool in many academic disciplines. Furthermore, it has also been immensely popular in several industrial sectors which have invested in adapting this open source software to their specific requirements. In this talk, we will share our learnings from developing and maintaining this open source research software that has been used more than 3,000,000 times since its public release in April 2017.', 'creators': [{'name': 'Dr. Abhishek Dutta', 'affiliation': 'University of Oxford, UK', 'orcid': '0000-0002-5455-3343'}], 'communities': [{'identifier': 'sorse'}], 'conference_title': 'International Series of Online Research Software Events', 'conference_acronym': 'SORSE', 'conference_url': 'https://sorse.github.io', 'access_right': 'open', 'license': 'cc-by-4.0'}}

While the term Research Software Engineering was initially suggested in 2010, there are many different definitions of Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and their community. The US-RSE Association uses "We like an inclusive definition of Research Software Engineers to encompass those who regularly use expertise in programming to advance research." One of the first community events of the US-RSE Association was a Birds-of-Feather session at PEARC19, where the discussion revealed that participants wanted to learn if the RSE community could include them, and questions arose who would be interested in such an association and community beyond RSEs themselves. These discussions have continued since then and we realized that any definition of RSE will probably change over time.\n\nThe mission of US-RSE focuses on three areas: 1) Creating a professional community to share knowledge, connections, and resources; 2) Promoting RSEs\' impact on research, highlighting the critical and valuable role RSEs serve; and 3) Providing access to information and material to support individuals and RSE groups. The main focal point is the community and we used it in the name of the association: RSE in US-RSE is "Research Software Engineer".\n\nIn addition to naming the association, creating a code of conduct, and announcing and organizing events, reaching out to the full, diverse community needs a careful selection of terms in order to be inclusive and make everyone feel welcome as part of the community. The talk will go into detail about how we have been approaching inclusivity. Our goal is to actively discuss and raise more and more awareness of the topic to improve inclusivity in our outreach and in the community in general.', 'creators': [{'name': 'Sandra Gesing', 'affiliation': 'University of Notre Dame, US', 'orcid': '0000-0002-6051-0673'}, {'name': 'Dr. Daniel S.

It is used today for Earthquake and Black Hole simulations,\nfor example. The fourth generation of the software is\ncurrently under development.\n\nPeano\'s development as well as the push behind ExaHyPE, a solver engine built\nupon Peano, always has been shaped by the ambition to implement\nstate-of-the-art numerics. In our field, this implies multiscale algorithms\nwhere others work with "flat" data structures, dynamically changing\ndata structures where others rely on something static, writing\nmulti-numerics/multi-physics codes where others focus on one thing, supporting hybrid architectures where others commit either to GPGPU- or\nCPU-only, and so forth.\n\nIn this talk I briefly categorise the software and present application areas. After that, I focus on the software\'s genesis. Peano\nhas started off as a collection of codes for solving incompressible fluids,\nyet spread out into many application areas,\nit has been shaped (and misshaped) by dozens of core\ndevelopers, and it has grown repeatedly into a state that\nmade it hard to maintain and extend further. Therefore, each generation has\nbecome a complete rewrite---also as we tried to bring in new, fancy numerics\nevery time.\n\nI will explain which software design patterns we use today in our framework\nin an attempt to deliver software that is fast, maintainable and usable for\nall the different communities involved. With our complex agenda, it is basically\nimpossible to find developers among PhDs, academics or RSEs that master all\nareas of relevance. So we need a strict separation of concerns (and flaws)\nwhich materialises in our code as the Hollywood Principle: Don\'t call us, we\ncall you. In short, we take a lot of freedom away from developers how they\ncan realise things. Instead, we force them to focus on what they want to do.', 'creators': [{'name': 'Dr. Tobias Weinzierl', 'affiliation': 'Durham University, UK', 'orcid': '0000-0002-6208-1841'}], 'communities': [{'identifier': 'sorse'}], 'conference_title': 'International Series of Online Research Software Events', 'conference_acronym': 'SORSE', 'conference_url': 'https://sorse.github.io', 'access_right': 'open', 'license': 'cc-by-4.0'}}

Quite often they are regarded as technicians and their function in research projects reduced to those of "helpers", diminishing their contribution to the success of the undertaking. Nowadays some students of the humanities are trained in digital technologies to bridge the information gap between the different fields (Digital Humanities, DH). A similar situation can be found  in Digital and Computational Archaeology, though the two disciplines only marginally influenced each other (Hugget [10.12759/hsr.37.2012.3.86-105](https://doi.org/10.12759/hsr.37.2012.3.86-105)). Some centers of Digital Archaeology work closely with DH departments and some DH specialists moved from archaeology to the broader field of DH, which shows that the job market in Digital Archaeology does not offer enough possibilities. The temporary nature of research related projects is another reason for an unstable job market in the field. To mitigate the effects of this instability, increased workload, surveillance and underappreciation, Hugget calls for a resilient scholarship in a digital age (Hugget [10.5334/jcaa.25](https://doi.org/10.5334/jcaa.25)). One important aspect he names on the individual level is forming a community for networking and support. We will present the "Research Squirrel Engineers", an open, diverse and international network, which aims at RSEs connecting and developing their own ideas for side projects independent from institutions (and funding). Within the Research Squirrel community, currently two members have an engineering background (computer science, geoinformatics) whereas the other two studied a humanities subject (archaeology). By focusing on their own research interests they help RSEs to retain joy in their job, diversify and showcase their skill sets. So far Squirrels focus on (Linked) Open Data projects, but are happy to receive suggestions and new research squirrels joining at SORSE.', 'creators': [{'name': 'Sophie Schmidt', 'affiliation': 'Deutsches Arch�ologisches Institut, Germany', 'orcid': '0000-0003-4696-2101'}, {'name': 'Florian Thiery', 'affiliation': 'Research Squirrel Engineers, Germany', 'orcid': '0000-0002-3246-3531'}, {'name': 'Timo Homburg', 'affiliation': 'Mainz University Of Applied Sciences, Germany', 'orcid': '0000-0002-9499-5840'}, {'name': 'Martina Trognitz', 'affiliation': 'Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage (ACDH-CH), Austria', 'orcid': '0000-0003-0485-6861'}], 'communities': [{'identifier': 'sorse'}], 'conference_title': 'International Series of Online Research Software Events', 'conference_acronym': 'SORSE', 'conference_url': 'https://sorse.github.io', 'access_right': 'open', 'license': 'cc-by-4.0'}}

To improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of research software, it is desirable to develop and apply a set of  FAIR Guiding Principles for software. Application of the FAIR principles to software will continue to advance the aims of the open science movement. [The FAIR 4 Research Software Working Group][1] (FAIR4RS WG) [aims][2] to enable coordination of existing community-led discussions on how to define and apply FAIR principles to research software, and achieve adoption of these principles. The [FAIR4RS WG][3] is jointly convened as an RDA Working Group, [FORCE11][4] Working Group, and [Research Software Alliance (ReSA) Taskforce][5], in recognition of the importance of this work.\nSince July 2020, the group has been analysing existing work in this area and has started drafting community-agreed-upon FAIR principles for research software. This workshop will provide the following opportunities:\n\n - Build skills in the development of principles and standards by contributing to the drafting of a set of FAIR principles relevant to research software.\n - Understand the fundamental properties and uses of research software.\n - Build new collaborations and engage with other RSEs and community members.\n - Identify pathways to create (or synthesise existing work on) other elements of the application of FAIR to research software for future collaborations, such as the development of FAIR software indicators, maturity models, curriculums and competence centres.\n - Consider how RSEs could play a critical role in advancing the FAIR for research software agenda, as early adopters, champions, case study contributors, and in ways that support regional/disciplinary RSE priorities.\n\nThe workshop will encourage collaboration around the drafting of FAIR for research software principles and will include progress updates on the four FAIR4RS [subgroups][6]\n\n  [1]: https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg\n  [2]: https://www.rd-alliance.org/node/69317/case-statement\n  [3]: https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg\n  [4]: https://www.force11.org/\n  [5]: https://www.researchsoft.org/taskforces/\n  [6]: https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg/post/fair-4-rs-webinars-2930-june', 'creators': [{'name': 'Dr. Anna-Lena Lamprecht', 'affiliation': 'Utrecht University, The Netherlands', 'orcid': '0000-0003-1953-5606'}, {'name': 'Dr. Daniel S.

Since the term was coined about a decade ago, RSE has also been the subject of empirical research to gain knowledge and evidence about the various aspects involved. For example, the 2017 "State of the Nation Report" by Alys Brett et al. (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.495360) presents survey data about the demographics of UK-based RSEs, and Rotem Botvinik-Nezer et al. (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2314-9) report on the extreme variability of results they found when they let many teams develop analysis programs for the same dataset. Such findings are the basis for the international RSE community to provide support and develop solutions for open problems.\n\nThis workshop aims to assess what we do and do not know about RSE. The participants will work together to collect and classify existing empirical research about RSE, and identify "blind spots" where further research is needed. After the workshop we plan to turn these findings into a review paper that describes both the current knowledge and open questions, suitable to serve as a roadmap for further research about RSE. All participants will be invited to contribute as co-authors.\n\nThe workshop will start with a short series of introductory presentations to set the stage. Then the participants will be split into thematic groups to discuss empirical research about different areas of RSE, such as RSE job profiles, RSE needs in different scientific domains, geographical differences in flourishing of RSE organizations, or specifics and challenges of software development processes in research. They will document their discussion in shared (Google) documents.
