title: RSE Research Challenges
type: workshop
...

RSE supports research across all disciplines, but there is also research about RSE. This includes the study of RSE processes to understand them better, as well as the development of technological solutions and social approaches to improve them. The idea for this workshop is to discuss “hot topics” and current challenges in RSE research.
