title: RSEs and their position
type: workshop
...

The field of activity of RSEs is very diverse and encompasses many facets. Since the role of RSEs in science is not yet clear everywhere, there are often problems with their pay scale classification into the TVÃ–D system. In the workshop, we want to present and discuss typical job descriptions and exchange experiences on how communication with the respective HR administrations can be designed.
