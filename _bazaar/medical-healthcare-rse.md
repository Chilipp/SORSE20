Software development is an integral part of (bio-) medical research. Research projects creating or extending software are run by departments that focus on different medical domains but have no support infrastructure for software engineering. Furthermore, software used in healthcare settings has to comply with medical device regulations which require a well-documented if not certified process for software engineering even in research setting. Medical Informatics research departments may hold the necessary expertise but are organised in project-centric fashion themselves, leaving little to no capacity for on-demand services or support. I would like to organize a workshop bringing together colleagues from medical research and medical informatics to discuss challenges and possible solutions.
