title: Developing, Distributing and Testing Research Software with Anaconda
type: workshops
...

The distribution of research software is challenging due to the complexity of dependencies and the speed of technological advancement. Automation and standardization of this process speeds up the development process, as well as the communication and interaction with the users. This is particularly important for research software, as the number of developers are limited and labor for infrastructural maintenance is usually not available.

In this workshop we want to discuss how the package manager anaconda ([https://conda.io](https://conda.io)) can be used to automate such a process. The package manager works for various different programming languages, and operating systems, and provides with the conda-forge channel a community-based platform to distribute and build your own packages.
