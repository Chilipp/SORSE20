There are a lot of RSEs working in the Digital Humanities (DH) or archaeological domian. Most of them a are not not named as Research Software Engineers even though they develop software for researchers or develop software for their own research. This slot should help to show others what RSEs in DH are doing and hopefully find some new collaborations. There are also some non-institutional groups in the DH which do RSE things just for fun in their free time. One of the groups are the [Research Squirrel Engineers](http://squirrel.link). If this slot will help to increase the ammount of squirrels, this would be awesome!
