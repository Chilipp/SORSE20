title: Legal Issues in Research Software Development
type: workshops
...

Collaborative software development (e.g. on various Git* platforms) are commonplace for research software project. Nevertheless, this is legal gray area, as many scientific institutions are (not yet) aquainted with this mode of operation and therefore have no explicit regulartory framework in place. The potential issues for the individual research are manifold:

 * Who owns the intellectual property on the contributed code and how is this documented?
 * Who is liable for potential bugs? What must be considered when choosing a FOSS license?
 * Is the use of public development platforms consistent with labor legislation, collective labor agreements and subordinate regulations?
 * When should code be considered a dual-use good?
