title: RSE for Human-centered Research Workflow Support Systems
type: workshop
...

Even if there exist various approaches and repositories for storing and manageing meta- and research data, the software landscape still lacks of adequate support of a phase oriented end-to-end data assessment-workflow that is closely linked to the research process. User Experience and Usability of such solutions is a further major topic, besides high interoperability to existing repository software such as dspace and dataverse. I would like to bring in a workshop topic for discussion - not sure if this is the right level of abstraction. Relevant expertises are from my point of view research data managers to discuss challenges and requirements, database and workflow management as well as human computer interaction experts to discuss possible solutions.
