title: 'Examples and Discussion: How to do good tutorials for research software'
type: workshop
...

Good tutorials are probably the best measure to get others to use and contribute to your research software. We believe that we can learn a lot from each other when it comes to designing good tutorials (educational level, extent, virtual environments, â€¦). Different scientific communities follow different styles and the RSE conference brings many different communities together. In this workshop, we want to introduce these different styles of tutorials and discuss them with everybody.
