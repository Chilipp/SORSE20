Were you going to submit something to an RSE conference this year? Do you have a project you’d like to share? Is there a talk/workshop/panel you’d like to see happen? Then you’ve found the right place!

You can make a contribution to one of the event types (see the left hand menu), and/or suggest an event in the [Wishlist]({% include fix-link.html link="/programme/wishlist" %}) that you’d like to see in the series. Take a look at the [Topic Bazaar]({% include fix-link.html link=site.data.committee.programme_teams.bazaar.internal %}) if you have an idea but want to find collaborators before submitting. We’re looking for both technical and soft skills and there are no set themes this year but if a theme emerges, we may group those events together to create a half day event or a run of events over a few weeks.

We encourage contributions from all time zones and will schedule events on a day and at a time that suits the presenter. Events will be recorded so that they can be run multiple times to suit different time zones and encourage those communities to come together to network.

The Call for Contributions form will remain open continuously and there will be a rolling monthly deadline following which all contributions received over the previous month will be sent for review by the [Programme Committee]({% include fix-link.html link=site.data.committee.committees.programme.internal %}).

The call is open to anyone wanting to propose a research software-related talk or event from anywhere in the world, regardless of your role.

Upcoming contribution deadlines are all detailed below. Each contribution deadline will have an earliest event date when events submitted prior to that deadline can take place. You can propose an event for any date or range of dates beyond this.

See our [schedule of events]({% include fix-link.html link="/" %}) for details of what’s coming up.
