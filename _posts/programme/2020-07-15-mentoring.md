Presenting at a conference, be it face-to-face or online, can be daunting, especially if you do not have a lot of experience presenting. Presenting online brings additional challenges, like handling of the technology, the (more or less) anonymous online-space, and the strange feeling of being in front of a camera.

Whether you are a first-time presenter or not, if you feel that you could do with some practical advice for preparing and/or presenting your poster or talk, we can help you. We have a pool of volunteers from the RSE community who are happy to share their experience in presenting in online and offline conferences, and to give you a hand with your presentation. Just indicate that you would like mentoring when you submit your contribution, and give some details in which areas you would like help.

Similarly, if you just need some advice or practice using the online tools, just let us know!

As SORSE is an ongoing event series, we are also always looking for more mentors. So, if you have experience with presenting and would be happy to help a junior/less experienced presenter, please drop us an email at sorse.enquiries@gmail.com and we will add you to our mentor pool. When there is a request for a mentor we will get in touch with the person from the pool we feel is most suited to help this particular mentee.
