To kick off our series, we ran the SORSE Launch
Event on Wednesday 2nd September. We had
two keynote speakers at this event:

- Dr Mariann Hardey, Associate Professor, Durham University: _Switching off the label "women in tech"_
- Dr Kari Jordan, Executive Director, The Carpentries: _I wanna dance with somebody_

The session began with a short welcome and introduction to SORSE followed
by two 30 minute keynote talks. Dr Mariann Hardey spoke on the subject of
women in tech and Dr Kari Jordan spoke about the Carpentries. The talks were
followed by time for questions and then an opportunity for further discussion
and networking in breakout rooms.
