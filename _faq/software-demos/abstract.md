title: What should be in my Software demos abstract
...

The abstract should be relatively brief and attention-grabbing rather than an exhaustive explanation of the material and technical details you wish to cover. It should include a brief description of the software you will demonstrate, and any prerequisite skills or background knowledge you expect your audience to have, e.g. knowledge of a particular language, technology, or methodology. You should also highlight if your software has a particular relevance to a specific research community.
Abstracts should be no more than 300 words.
