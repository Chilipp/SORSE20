## Registration

Registration for each event will be via dedicated registration link on its webpage.
All data will be deleted from Indico after each event. The data will **not** be passed to Zoom or Discord. It will be possible to join the Zoom events via a link and a browser therefore no Zoom account is needed. The link and password to each event will be emailed to the registered participants an hour before the event is due to start.  If you agree for the sponsors to contact you when completing the registration form, the basic information of name and email address will be forwarded to the sponsors.

## Do I need to pay to attend SORSE events?

No! Itâ€™s completely free to the community with the national RSE Groups from many countries collaborating to bring this to you.
