With the cancellation of several international Research Software Engineering (RSE) community events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, RSEs worldwide are facing a lack of opportunities to engage with their wider community. To address this challenge, SORSE has been launched by an [international committee](contact/#international-committee-members) to provide an opportunity for RSEs to develop and grow their skills, build new collaborations and engage with RSEs worldwide. Until we can meet again in person, SORSE (pronounced ‘Source’), will bridge the gap and be the source of interesting and engaging events.

This is an open call to all RSEs and anyone involved with research software, worldwide, to propose talks, workshops and other types of online events.

The aims of the event series:

- To create and deliver a range of permanent resources for RSEs to develop both technical and soft skills, giving them the opportunity to contribute to and learn from the series
- To develop and share knowledge about the field of research software e.g. how is Research Software built and used, how do we learn the skills to improve its sustainability and reliability, how do we apply it in our research, demonstrating its importance to research
- To encourage involvement with the collection efforts of personal and technical RSE journeys (Podcasts etc) to better understand the makeup and demographics of our community and promote diversity and inclusivity
- To develop new research relationships that may lead to future collaborations and strengthen international links within the community
- To provide a ‘Show and Tell’ opportunity for RSEs to present their ideas and their work to an international audience
- To maintain the momentum of the RSE movement by helping to build and support the national and international Research Software Communities
