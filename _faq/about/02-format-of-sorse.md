SORSE will deliver a range of different types of events in ideally a 1 hour or 2 hour time slot (but the event could be shorter), followed by time for networking and discussion with other participants. We will organise an event every two weeks in English with the option of a national event (in the mother tongue) taking place in the alternating weeks.  We hope that this series will be popular so that we can continue it into 2021.

We’re an [informal community](contact/#international-committee-members) and we know life is busy and very different at the moment, so feel free to join events when you can and leave when you need to.

Event types include:

(Descriptions will be added by the programme team soon, here we should link to the corresponding subteam pages)

- Talks - both technical and soft skills
- Workshops
- [Software demos]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.data.committee.programme_teams.software_demo.internal }})
- Poster sessions with Lightning talks
- Panel & Discussion session

Along with these events above, we will be inviting guest speakers from around the world to join us and we’re happy to take suggestions for guest speakers via the [Topic Bazaar](){: .missing}.
