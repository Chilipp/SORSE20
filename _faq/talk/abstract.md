title: What should be in my Talks abstract
...
A good talk abstract should include:
- Relevant introductory background information on the chosen topic
- What attendees will learn (Learning outcomes)
- Key message
- How attendees will benefit
- Target audience
- (if available) links to further reading about the topic (e.g. link to 
  a github repo if a piece of software is somehow involved in the talk)
