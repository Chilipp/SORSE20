title: What should be in my Posters and Lightning talks abstract
...

Abstracts must include sufficient information for reviewers to judge the nature and significance of the topic and the conclusions. The abstract should summarize the substantive results of the work and not merely list topics to be discussed.An abstract is an outline/brief summary of your poster and your whole project. It should have an intro, body and conclusion. It is a well-developed paragraph, should be exact in wording, and must be understandable to a wide audience. If your title includes scientific notation, Greek letters, bold, italics, or other special characters/symbols, do make sure they appear correctly.
