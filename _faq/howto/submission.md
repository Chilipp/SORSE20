The call for submissions will remain open and there will be a rolling monthly deadline following which all submissions received over the previous month will be sent for review by the Programme Committee. The call is open to anyone wanting to propose a research software-related talk or event from anywhere in the world, regardless of your role.   Upcoming submission deadlines are all detailed on the [submissions page](){: .missing}. Each submission deadline will have an earliest event date when events submitted prior to that deadline can take place. You can propose an event for any date or range of dates beyond this.

See our [schedule of events](){: .missing} for details of whatâ€™s coming up.
