During the series, we will be using Zoom meeting and Zoom webinar as well as live streaming the events via YouTube Live for presenting sessions, interacting with the talk speakers as well as for software demos, panels and workshops. No registration is required to view events via either platform.

We will also use Discord for our poster session and for persistant chat, you can join the [UK RSE slack space](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9LqOWGwA1xDvSgy81eimcb9s0cNBFso0zv0_HoZz16G1M5w/viewform?c=0&w=1).
