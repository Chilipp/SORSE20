Were you going to submit something to an RSE conference this year? Do you have a project you’d like to share? Is there a talk/workshop/panel you’d like to see happen? Then you’ve found the right place!

You can make a contribution to one of the event types, see our [call for contributions](){: .missing} and/or suggest an event in the [Wishlist]({% include fix-link.html link="/programme/wishlist" %}) that you’d like to see in the series. Take a look at the [Topic Bazaar]({% include fix-link.html link="/programme/bazaar" %}) if you have an idea but want to find collaborators before submitting. We’re looking for both technical and soft skills and there are no set themes this year but if a theme emerges, we may group those events together to create a half day event or a run of events over a few weeks.

We encourage contributions from all time zones and will schedule events on a day and at a time that suits the presenter. Events will be recorded so that they can be run multiple times to suit different time zones and encourage those communities to come together to network.
