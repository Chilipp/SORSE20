We welcome blog posts for the SORSE website blog at [https://researchsoftware.org/blog](){: .missing }. These may be linked to SORSE events such as talks, posters or software demos, or they can be standalone. We are happy to accept blog posts that will appeal to a general audience as well as those that are tailored to a more specialist technical audience.
