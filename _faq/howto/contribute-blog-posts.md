We welcome blog posts for the SORSE website blog. These may be linked to SORSE events such as talks, posters or software demos, or they can be standalone. We are happy to accept blog posts that will appeal to a general audience as well as those that are tailored to a more specialist technical audience.

Finalised blog posts should be 750-2000 words in length.

Just [get in touch]({% include fix-link.html link="/contact/" %}).
