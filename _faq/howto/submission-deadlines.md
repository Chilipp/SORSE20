The Call for Contributions form will remain **open continuously** and there will be a
**rolling deadline at the end of the last day (UTC) of each month**, following
which all contributions received over the previous month will be sent for review
by the [Programme Committee]({{ site.data.committee.committees.programme.internal | relative_url }}).

See the [Call for Contributions]({{ "programme/call-for-contributions" | relative_url }})
for more information on how to submit an abstract.
