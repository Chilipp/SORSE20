title: What should be in my Panels and Discussions abstract
...
Please describe your topic, how its is relevant to the RSE community right now,
how the topic of the session aligns with the topic of the conference in general,
and what is the added advantage of discussing it with the broader audience. For
panel discussions, please also mention how the expertises of your plenary
speakers will shed light on different aspects of the topic. For open discussion,
please list subtopics that can be discussed in breakout groups.
